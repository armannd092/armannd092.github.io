      <description>PlanGo is a new way to interface with schedule planning. For many years we tend to plan our upcoming daily life to optimize our time and resources. This device tends to find the middle ground between 100% digital planning platform and paper base planning. Each of these has its advantage and disadvantages. For instance, Digital calendars are the best in synchronizing your time with colleges and across different devices. However, they are often complicated to work with it.</description>

      <description>SPML is a project started in the future learning unit of Fablab Barcelona. It tends to make the CNC machine accessible for students and let them understand the functionality of cartesian base machines. Furthermore, it can help the students to fabricate small mold and PCB at home. The current project is a child version of the main project, which tries to add two extra axes to the machine and make five axes machine.</description>

      <description>COVID Map is Live map visualization which demonstrates peoples feeling about the coronavirus outbreak. It is watching public tweets and tries to understand if they are positive or negative. In this manner, it uses vectorizing each word base on its dictionary. One of my discoveries from this map is the countries that have access restrictions to this social media like China and Iran. Also, the limitation of this system is that it can just understand English.</description>

      <description>Bosc Nocturn (en. Light Forrest) is an interactive installation, which invites people to enjoy the play of light. While combining both audition and vision, visitors can interact and change the light movement by their input through the microphones. Their voice will be reflected in the space with different filters.

      <description>The Eye is a single web platform which help the urban designer and decision maker to simulate and predict the impact of different urban planning scenarios. This platform uses real-time data through the computer algorithm and machine learning in order to transform the raw data to the knowledge about cities dynamic state. Furthermore, the project open up a new workflow for urban planning by providing a range of concussion that proposals will may cause.</description>

      <description>T-point is an experience on how robot arm can sense and interact with human. In the first phase the robot has to be aware of its position in the environment. The next challenge is to recognize the user in the environment. Later on user can have live interaction with robot. Moreover by taking the control of the robot you will be able to compose sounds and lights.

      <description>This research project studies and analyses the performance of timber laminates with MUF (melamine urea-formaldehyde) resin and wood particles (sawdust). Timber laminates are pre-programmed by understanding its behavior through simulations with the help of computational tools. Advanced learning and using digital tools will always help to push boundaries for understanding a material better. Its properties to react with different materials, applied forces, physical attributes etc. is crucial to investigate in order to understand their behavior, especially while studying those of new composites.</description>

      <description>Good wood is a new perspective to Recycling wood with the help of computational design and robotic fabrication. This project tries to present a process to target the scrap wood, which left from the construction as a base material to build a shelter. This approach gets advantages from computational tools and robotic fabrication to detect, match, and fabricate the elements of the shell.

      <description>This project aims to design and fabricate a 2*1.2 meter acoustic panel. For designing, an agent-based approach has been obtained to maximize the cavity in the solid material and trap the sound wave into itself. In the fabrication strategy, the double-side CNC milling approach with a 12mm flat bite has been applied

      <description>Architecture is a discipline that forces mathematics to escape the theoretical realm and confront the tangible. With Islamic patterns - as a singular example of the integration of mathematics in design - the application in the world of craft, as ceramic tiles, results in the complex non-hierarchical superficial motives that ornament so many spaces of the Islamic world.

      <description>Hyperloop LA was experimentation on the minimal surfaces as an architectural geometry to contain a hyperloop station in Los Angeles. This study started by base component study and continued toward a parametric development of it. With the manipulation of the geometry regardless of the architectural function the capability of the component has been found. Based on this knowledge, a broad catalog of the component was produced, which was the foundation of the final design of the station.</description>

      <description>The agenda is to further push the fabrication of curved surfaces with composite materials. However this time, the design studies of the work will be shifted from pure mathematics to the work and legacy of Felix Candela which still features a good deal of math and geometry in his works. By ‘Re-Envisioning Candela’, the idea is to study the intricacy as well as technicality and methodology of his work and to push it towards further computational design of the shell/surface geometries.</description>

      <description>Digital world and rise of modern computers have affected our life in various ways. Yet architecture is one of this fields that thrives on the digital phenomena to promote new perspectives in desing and fabrication through this age. However, current CAD tools and softwares are still far less than perfect in the way they interact with humans. Thus in a quest to develop more innate ways for human-computer interaction we came up with the idea of Glove Operation Design.</description>
