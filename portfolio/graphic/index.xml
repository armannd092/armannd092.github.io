      <description>Super Block is an urban plan project to in Barcelona that tries to reduce the traffic in the city and increase the green area for more human centric environment. However this project is my contribution to a signage development by a graphist for a new Superblock emerging in Example neighborhood. The project was part of his bachelor thesis. I was consulting and assisting him from urban planner point of view to develop his project further.</description>

      <description>This is an ongoing hobby inspired by an Artist named KingRaam. He started a podcast at the beginning of the pandemic and I create these graphics inspired by his stories and music. These works might end up on his merch that he started recently. Check his website if your interested.
